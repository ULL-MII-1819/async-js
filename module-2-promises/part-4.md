In Part 4 of the tutorial, we will edit the JavaScript file `productCatalog.js` to do the following:

* Populate the "Examined Product" section when a product id is searched or when an `Examine Button` is pressed
* Populate the "List of Similar Products" with products similar to the `searched/examined` product when a product `id` is searched or when an `Examine` button is pressed.
