Hello.
In this video, I'll be introducing the assignment for
this module, which is to build a web application for
comparing starships using the Star Wars API.
Let's start by looking at how the completed assignment
should function.
The web application should have two dropdown lists full of starships.
To the right of the drop-down lists there should be a button labeled
Compare.
Clicking the Compare button will populate the table with the details
of the starships being compared.
In each of the rows, the starship property
with the highest value will have its cells highlighted red.
For example, if I compare the Millennium Falcon with the V-Wing,
we can see that the V-wing has its cost cell highlighted red,
while the Millennium Falcon has its cargo size and
passenger cells highlighted red.
Also, since the two ships have the same speed,
neither of their speed cells are highlighted.
Please read the assignment guidelines page for
the exact details on how the assignment will be graded.
Good luck and happy coding.
