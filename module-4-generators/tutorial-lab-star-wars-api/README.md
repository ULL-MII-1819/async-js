## Transcription

Hello, in this video, I will be introducing the assignment for
this module,
which is to build a web application that uses the Star Wars API to allow
users to find out which characters were in each Star Wars movie.
Generators will be used to simplify the writing of asynchronous code.
Let's start by looking at how the completed
application should function.
The web application is simple, it should have an input field for
the Star Wars episode number and a search button next to it.
Pressing the search button will populate the film name and
character section of the application.
The Star Wars API takes a couple of seconds to finish processing.
But eventually it finishes.
This tutorial is meant to teach you how to use generators with promises
to write more readable asynchronous code.
Please read the tutorial pages for
the exact details on how to create the application.
Good luck, and happy coding.
