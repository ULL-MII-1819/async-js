In Part 3, we will write JavaScript code to do the following:

1. turn cells purple when a matching pair is found
1. turn cells blue again when a two cells are clicked and they are not a matching pair
1. make the border of the table to temporarily turn red when a non matching pair is found
1. end the game when four matching pairs are found
1. send an alert when the game ends telling the user how much time they took to complete the game
1. stop the elapsed time counter from counting when the game ends
