In this video, I'll be introducing the tutorial lab for this module,
which is to create a memory match game using event-driven and
asynchronous concepts.

Let's start by looking at how the completed game should function.
A three by three grid of blue tiles should appear in the application.
Each tile has a hidden number behind it and
the goal of the game is to find ll the matching pairs of tiles.

Clicking a tile will turn it red temporarily and
also reveal the hidden number behind the tile.
If you click two tiles and the numbers do not match, they will
return red again and the player tries again to find matching tiles.
If the tiles do match, they turn purple and remain face up.
Once the player finds all the matching pairs, the game ends and
the time it took to complete the game is shown.

The player may restart the game at any time by pressing the restart
button, and the numbers behind the tiles should change.
This tutorial is meant to teach you how to write event-driven
code to handle user interactions and
to also use a synchronous code to not block user interactions.

Please read the tutorial pages for
the exact details on how to create the application.
Good luck and happy coding.
