Hello.

In this video, I'll be introducing the assignment for
this module, which is to build a web application that detects how old
a face is using the face API from Microsoft Cognitive Services.
Let's start by looking at
how the completed assignment should function.
The web application should have an input for a URL string and
a button labeled Analyze.
If I put a URL in the field and hit Analyze,
an image should appear and the attributes section
should fill with the age of the face and the gender of the face.
If I change the URL, different results should appear.
For example, if I put in my own face,
It appears that the API thinks I'm 27 years-old and
that's sort of close, but I'm actually 22.
It got the gender correct, though.
Lastly, if I put an image of something that doesn't resemble
a face, such as a pineapple, the application should,
Throw an error and show that no faces were detected.
Please read the assignment guidelines page for
the exact details on how the assignment will be graded.
Good luck and happy coding.
